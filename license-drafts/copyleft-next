THIS IS A DRAFT. DO NOT USE AS A LICENSE.

                     copyleft-next ("this License")

0. Basic Definitions.

   "Covered Work" means the Received Work or a Derived Work.

   "Derived Work" means a work of authorship that copies from,
   modifies, adapts, is based on, includes, transforms or translates
   all or part of the Received Work such that copyright permission is
   required. Derived Works do not include Mere Aggregation or the mere
   making of a verbatim copy of the Received Work.

   "Distribute" means to transfer or make available a copy of a work
   to someone else (in the case of an organization, to someone outside
   of the organization), such that copyright permission is required.

   "Distributor" means any individual or organization that
   Distributes a Covered Work, including Us.

   "Mere Aggregation" means an aggregation of a Covered Work with
   another work that is separate from, independent of, and is not by
   its nature an extension or enhancement of, the Covered
   Work. However, if the license of an aggregation restricts users
   from exercising rights under this License with respect to the
   Covered Work, the aggregation is not Mere Aggregation.

   "Received Work" means the particular work of authorship We make
   available to You under this License.

   "We"/"Us"/"Our" refers to the individual or organization that
   places the Received Work under This License.

1. License Grants.

   Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, including
   termination under section 8, We grant you the following licenses:

   (a) A non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright
       license, for the duration of Our copyright in the Received
       Work, to make, copy, Distribute, publicly perform and publicly
       display Covered Works, in any medium.

   (b) A non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable patent
       license under Licensed Patents to make, have made, use, sell,
       offer for sale, import and otherwise transfer Covered
       Works. "Licensed Patents" means all patent claims licensable by
       Us, now or in the future, that are necessarily infringed by
       making, using, or selling the Received Work, but do not include
       claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further
       modification of the Received Work.

   This License is not intended to exclude or limit (i) any rights you
   have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing
   or other equivalents, and (ii) any implied license or other defense
   to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under
   applicable patent law.

   This License does not grant any rights in Our name, trademarks,
   service marks, or logos.

2. Distribution: General Conditions.

   You may Distribute a Covered Work, provided that you meet all of
   these conditions:

   (a) Keep intact all legal notices and textual author attributions
       contained in the Received Work (in the case of a Derived Work,
       to the extent such notices remain pertinent), and include a
       copy of this License along with the Covered Work or notice of a
       canonical Internet address at which a copy of this License is
       publicly available.

   (b) For a Derived Work: 

       License the entire Derived Work under this License, and include
       prominent notice of such licensing. This condition may not be
       avoided through such means as separate Distribution.  This
       condition shall not apply to your Derived Work if We
       Proprietary-Relicense. "Proprietary-Relicense" means to
       commercially offer a work that would be a Covered Work had you
       prepared it, under a license that fails to satisfy version
       1.111 of the Free Software Definition as published by the Free
       Software Foundation ("FSF").

   (c) Make the waiver and disclaimer of section 4.

3. Object Code Distribution.

   (a) General Definitions.  

       "Minimum Period", with respect to a Covered Work embodied in a
       Product, means the longer of (i) three years from the date of
       your Distribution of the Covered Work in the Product, or (ii)
       the period during which you offer spare parts or customer
       support for the Product.

       "Object Code" means any form of a work that is not Source Code.

       "Product" means a physical product or tangible storage medium.

       "Source Code" means the preferred form of a work for making
       modifications to it.

       "System Libraries" means [FIXME].

   (b) Definition of Corresponding Source.
  
       "Corresponding Source" of a work means all the Source Code
       needed to build, compile, generate, modify, install, and run
       the work, to the extent those activities are meaningful
       ("Development Activities").

       Corresponding Source includes:
      
       * all relevant scripts and known instructions (even if
         previously unrecorded) necessary for a skilled person to
         effectively perform, control and/or complete Development
         Activities

       * interface definition files 

       * the Source Code of shared libraries and dynamically-linked
         subprograms that the work is specifically designed to
         require, such as by intimate data communication or control
         flow between those subprograms and parts of the work.

       Corresponding Source does not include: 

       * general-purpose tools used in performing Development
         Activities but which are separate from and independent of the
         work
 
       * the work's System Libraries.

   (c) Conditions.

       You may Distribute a Covered Work in Object Code form, provided
       that you also Distribute its machine-readable Corresponding
       Source under this License, in one of the following ways:

       (i) If you Distribute such Object Code in a Product, either

	 1) Accompany the Product with a durable physical medium
            customarily used for software interchange that contains
            the Corresponding Source, or

         2) Ensure that the Corresponding Source is publicly
            available, at no charge and for the Minimum Period, by way
            of a network location, and accompany the Product with
            notice of such location.

      (ii) If you Distribute such Object Code from a network location,
           accompany it with information giving clear directions
           indicating how the Corresponding Source may be obtained
           from a network location at no further charge and in a
           reasonably equivalent manner.

4. Anticircumvention Waiver and Disclaimer.

   Each Distributor of a Covered Work (i) waives all rights to forbid
   circumvention of technological measures achieved by exercising
   rights under this License with respect to a Covered Work, and (ii)
   disclaims any intention to limit operation or modification of the
   Received Work as a means of enforcing such Upstream Distributor's
   or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
   technological measures.
  
5. Direct Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

   Each time you Distribute a Covered Work, the recipient
   automatically receives from Us a license to the Received Work under
   this License.

6. No Further Restrictions; Inbound License Compatibility.

   You may not impose further restrictions on the exercise of the
   rights granted or affirmed under this License ("Further
   Restrictions").

   No violation of this section is excused merely because Further
   Restrictions result from your compliance with conditions extrinsic
   to this License, such as conditions imposed by court order or set
   forth in a separate agreement between you and a third party.

   Distribution of a Covered Work incorporating material covered by
   one of the following licenses does not impose Further Restrictions:

   * Apache License 2.0 <http:///www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html>
   * MIT License <http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>
   * 3-clause BSD License <http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>
   * zlib license <http://www.gzip.org/zlib/zlib_license.html>
   * Zope Public License Version 2.1 <http://www.zope.com/about_us/legal/zpl.html>

   This list is illustrative and is intended to guide interpretation.

7. Outbound License Compatibility.

   You may relicense Covered Works under the terms of any version of a
   GNU Strong Copyleft License. No condition of this License that
   would conflict with the chosen GNU Strong Copyleft License shall
   survive such relicensing. "GNU Strong Copyleft License" means (i)
   the GNU General Public License, version 2; (ii) the GNU General
   Public License, version 3; (iii) the GNU Affero General Public
   License, version 3; and/or (iv) a later version of one or more of
   the foregoing licenses, all as officially released by the FSF.

8. Termination.

   (a) If you fail to comply with the conditions of this License,
       then, unless and until you cure such failure within thirty days
       after becoming aware of such noncompliance, then your license
       grants under section 1 are automatically terminated. 

       Termination of your rights does not terminate the rights of
       those who have received copies or rights from you subject to
       this License.

       Termination of your rights in the Received Work disqualifies
       you from receiving new licenses for copies of the Received
       Work.

   (b) If you initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
       claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims,
       and cross-claims) alleging that any portion of the Received
       Work directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then your
       license grants under section 1 are automatically terminated.

   (c) Your right to make copies necessarily incident to running
       Covered Works shall never be terminated.

9. Or-Later.

   The initial License Steward is [FIXME]. The License Steward may
   publish new versions of copyleft-next.  Each version will be given
   a distinguishing version number. You may Distribute a Covered Work
   under the terms of this License or under the terms of a newer
   version of copyleft-next published by the License Steward.

10. Disclaimer of Warranty.

    The Received Work is provided "as-is".  You bear the risk of using
    it.  Distributors give no express warranties.  You may have
    additional rights under applicable law which this License cannot
    change.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, each
    Distributor excludes the implied warranties of title,
    merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and
    non-infringement.

11. Limitation of Liability.

    To the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will any
    Distributor be liable for any damages whatsoever, whether direct,
    indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages, whether
    arising under contract, tort (including negligence), strict
    liability, breach of warranty, misrepresentation or otherwise,
    even where the Distributor knew or should have known about the
    possibility of such damages.

12. Severability.

    If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
    of the remainder of this License, and reviewing courts shall
    reform such provision to the minimum extent necessary to make such
    provision valid and enforceable.
