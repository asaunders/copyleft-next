THIS IS A DRAFT. DO NOT USE AS A LICENSE.

                             copyleft-next

  0. Definitions.

  "License" means the terms and conditions defined in this document.

  "You" means an individual or Entity exercising rights under this
License.

  "Entity" means the union of the acting entity and all other entities
that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that
entity. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the
power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of
such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of
fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii)
beneficial ownership of such entity.

  "Received Work" means the particular work of authorship made
available to You under this License.

  "Licensor" means the individual(s), entity or entities that grant a
license to the Received Work under this License.

  "Essential Patent Claims" means all Licensable patent claims,
whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that are necessarily
infringed by making, using, or selling the Received Work, but do not
include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of
further modification of the Received Work.

  "Licensable" patent claim means a patent claim owned or controlled
by Licensor or as to which Licensor has the right to grant patent
sublicenses under terms consistent with the requirements of this
License.

  "Derivative" means a work of authorship that copies from, modifies,
adapts, is based on, transforms or translates all or part of the
Received Work such that copyright permission is required, but does not
include (i) the mere making, in isolation, of a verbatim copy of the
entire Work or a subset of it, or (ii) Mere Aggregation.

  "Mere Aggregation" means a collection of a Covered Work with other
separate and independent works on a storage or distribution medium, to
the extent such other works are not by their nature extensions or
enhancements of the Covered Work, unless the license of the collection
would limit a user from exercising rights under this License with
respect to the Covered Work.

  "Covered Work" means either the Received Work or a Derivative.

  "Source Code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  

  "Object Code" means any form of a work other than Source Code.

  "Corresponding Source" for an Object Code work means all the Source
Code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the
object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those
activities.  However, it does not include the work's System Libraries
(as defined below), or general-purpose tools or generally available
free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities
but which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the Source Code of shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  "System Libraries" of an executable work means any part of the work
that is normally distributed with (i) the major components (kernel,
window system, and so on) of the operating system on which the
executable runs or (ii) a compiler used to produce the executable or
(iii) an object code interpreter used to run the executable.

  "Inbound Contribution" means a work intentionally submitted by You
to Licensor for inclusion in a modified or successor version of the
Received Work.

  "Distribute" means to transfer or make available copies of Covered
Works to others, to the extent such activity requires copyright
permission. For the avoidance of doubt, "Distribution" does not
include mere interaction with a user through a computer network,
without any transfer of a Covered Work to the user.

  "GNU Strong Copyleft License" means (i) the GNU General Public
License, version 2; (ii) the GNU General Public License, version 3;
(iii) the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3; and/or (iv) a
later final version of any of the foregoing licenses, all as
officially released by the Free Software Foundation.

  "Proprietary Terms" means [to be defined].

  1. Basic Permissions.

  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor grants
You:

  (a) a worldwide, royalty-free, nonexclusive, perpetual license to
make, copy, Distribute, publicly perform and publicly display Covered
Works, in all cases in any medium or format; and

  (b) a worldwide, royalty-free, nonexclusive, perpetual patent
license under Essential Patent Claims, to make, use, sell, offer for
sale, import and otherwise transfer the contents of the Received Work.

  Permission to run Covered Works is entirely unconditional. For the
avoidance of doubt, You may charge any fee for (i) Distributing
Covered Works, and (ii) providing services to recipients of Covered
Works.

  This License is not intended to exclude or limit (i) any rights You
have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing or
other equivalents, and (ii) any implied license or other defense to
infringement that may otherwise be available to You under applicable
patent law.

  2. Trademarks.

  This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service
marks, or logos of Licensor.

  3. Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No Covered Work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When You distribute a Covered Work, You waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the Covered Work, and You disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, Your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Inbound = Outbound.

  Any Inbound Contribution shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions, unless you
explicitly indicate otherwise at the time You submit the Inbound
Contribution.

  5. Distribution: General.

  You may Distribute a Covered Work, provided that You meet all of
these conditions:

  a) Keep intact all copyright notices, notices of the applicability
     of this License, and warranty disclaimers contained in the
     Received Work (in the case of a Derivative, to the extent such
     notices remain applicable), and include a copy of this License
     along with the Covered Work or a pointer to a canonical network
     address at which a copy of this License is publicly available..

  c) For a Derivative:

    i) Include prominent notice that the Derivative is released under
        this License.

   ii) You must license the entire Derivative, as a whole, under this
       License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
       License will therefore apply to the whole of the Derivative,
       and all its parts, regardless of how they are
       packaged. However, if Licensor commercially offers a Covered
       Work under Proprietary Terms, this clause c)iii) shall not
       apply to Your Derivative.

  6. Object Code Distribution.

  You may Distribute a Covered Work in Object Code form, provided that
You also distribute the machine-readable Corresponding Source under
the terms of this License, in one of the following ways:

    a) Simultaneous Availability of Corresponding Source:

      i) Distribute the Object Code in a physical product or tangible
         storage medium, accompanied by either a durable physical
         medium customarily used for software interchange that
         contains the Corresponding Source, or notice of a network
         location from which the Corresponding Source can be retrieved
         at no further charge. Or, 

     ii) Distribute the Object Code from a network location
         accompanied by information giving clear directions indicating
         how the Corresponding Source may be obtained from a network
         location at no further charge and in a reasonably equivalent
         manner.

    b) Offer for Source: Distribute the Object Code accompanied by a
       written offer, valid for at least three years and (where the
       Object Code is Distributed in a physical product) valid for as
       long as You offer spare parts or customer support for that
       product model, to give any third party a copy of the
       Corresponding Source either (1) on a durable physical medium
       customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more
       than Your reasonable cost of performing this Distribution of
       Corresponding Source, or (2) from a network server at no
       charge.

  7. Termination.

  You may not copy, distribute or modify a Covered Work except as
expressly provided under this License.  Any unauthorized act of
copying, distribution or modification automatically terminates Your
rights under this License.

  However, if You cease all violation of this License, then Your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates Your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify You of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, Your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies You of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and You cure the violation prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of Your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from You under
this License.  If Your rights have been terminated and are not
permanently reinstated, You do not qualify to receive new licenses for
the same material under section 8.

  8. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time You Distribute a Covered Work, the recipient automatically
receives from Licensor a license to the Received Work subject to this
License.

  9. No Further Restrictions; Inbound License Compatibility.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License. 

  Further restrictions include, without limitation, initiation of
litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,
offering for sale, or importing the Received Work or any portion of
it.

  For the avoidance of doubt, Distribution of a Covered Work
incorporating material covered by the following free software licenses
is not imposition of a "further restriction". This list of licenses is
illustrative rather than exhaustive and is meant to guide general
interpretation of the initial clause of this section: 
    i) Apache License 2.0 as published by the Apache
Software Foundation 
   ii) MIT License, version at http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
  iii) 3-clause BSD License, version at http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause

  If a license document contains a further restriction but permits
relicensing or Distributing under this License, You may add to a
Covered Work material governed by the terms of that license document,
provided that the further restriction does not survive such
relicensing or Distributing.

  10. Liberty or Death.

  If conditions are imposed on You (whether by court order, agreement
or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
not excuse You from the conditions of this License.  If You cannot
Distribute a Covered Work in a way that would satisfy simultaneously
Your requirements under this License and any pertinent obligations
extrinsic to this License, then as a consequence You may not
Distribute it at all.  For example, if You agree to terms that
obligate You to collect a royalty for further distributing from those
to whom You Distribute a Covered Work, the only way You could satisfy
both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from
Distributing Covered Works.

  You may Distribute a Covered Work knowingly relying on a Patent
License if (i) the Corresponding Source of the Covered Work (or, for a
Covered Work in Source Code form, such Source Code) is available for
anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License,
through a publicly available network server, or (ii) the Patent
License is available to all downstream recipients under terms not
inconsistent with this License.  "Knowingly relying" means You have
actual knowledge that, but for the Patent License, Your Distribution
of the Covered Work in a country, or Your recipient's use of the
Covered Work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable
patents in that country that You have reason to believe are valid. A
"Patent License" as used in this paragraph means any express agreement
or commitment not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission
to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).

  11. Outbound Compatibility with GNU Strong Copyleft Licenses.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, You have
permission to relicense any Covered Work under the terms of any
version of a GNU Strong Copyleft License. No condition of this License
that would conflict with the chosen GNU Strong Copyleft License shall
survive such relicensing.

  12. New Versions of this License.

  The initial License Steward is the Copyleft Next Group. The License
Steward may publish new versions of copyleft-next.  Each version will
be given a distinguishing version number. You may distribute a Covered
Work under the terms of the version of copyleft-next under which the
Received Work is licensed, or under the terms of any subsequent
version published by the License Steward.

  13. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Received Work is
provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without warranty of
any kind, either express, implied, or statutory, including, without
limitation, warranties that the Received Work is free of defects,
merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.  The
entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Received Work is
with You.  Should the Received Work prove defective in any respect,
You assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.
This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
License. No use of the Received Work is authorized under this License
except under this disclaimer.

  14. Limitation of Liability.

  In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who modifies
and/or distributes the Received Work as permitted above, be liable to
You for damages, including any general, special, incidental or
consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the
Received Work (including but not limited to loss of data or data being
rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by You or third parties or a
failure of the Received Work to operate with any other programs), even
if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of
such damages.
