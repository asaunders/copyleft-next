THIS IS A DRAFT. DO NOT USE AS A LICENSE.

                             copyleft-next

  0. Definitions.

  "License" means the terms defined in this document.

  "You" means the individual or organization exercising rights under
this License.

  "Received Work" means a particular work of authorship made available
to You under this License, or any subset of it.

  "We" means the individual or organization that places the Received
Work under this License.

  "Licensed Patents" means all Licensable patent claims, whether
already acquired or hereafter acquired, that are necessarily infringed
by making, using, or selling the Received Work, but do not include
claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further
modification of the Received Work.

  "Licensable" patent claim means a patent claim as to which We have
the power or right to grant patent licenses or sublicenses under terms
consistent with the requirements of this License

  "Derived Work" means a work of authorship that copies from,
modifies, adapts, is based on, transforms or translates all or part of
the Received Work such that copyright permission is required, but does
not include (i) the mere making, in isolation, of a verbatim copy of
the entire Work or a subset of it, or (ii) Mere Aggregation.

  "Mere Aggregation" means a collection of a Covered Work with other
separate and independent works on a storage or distribution medium, to
the extent such other works are not by their nature extensions or
enhancements of the Covered Work, unless the license of the collection
would limit a user from exercising rights under this License with
respect to the Covered Work.

  "Covered Work" means either the Received Work or a Derived Work.

  "Source Code" means the preferred form of a work for making
modifications to it.

  "Object Code" means any form of a work other than Source Code.

  "Corresponding Source" of a work means all the Source Code needed to
build, compile, generate, modify, install, and run the work (to the
extent those activities are meaningful for the work), including all
relevant scripts and instructions necessary to effectively perform,
control and/or complete those activities.  Corresponding Source does
not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools
which are used in performing those activities but which are separate
from and independent of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files, and the Source Code of shared
libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
parts of the work.

  "System Libraries" means [FIXME].

  "Inbound Contribution" means a work intentionally submitted by You
to Us for inclusion in a modified or successor version of the Received
Work.

  "Distribute" means to transfer or make available a copy of a work to
anyone else (in the case of an organization, to anyone outside of the
organization), to the extent such activity requires copyright
permission. 

  "Distributor" means an individual or organization that Distributes
the Received Work.

  "GNU Strong Copyleft License" means (i) the GNU General Public
License, version 2; (ii) the GNU General Public License, version 3;
(iii) the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3; and/or (iv) a
later final version of any of the foregoing licenses, all as
officially released by the Free Software Foundation.

  "Proprietary Terms" means [FIXME].

  1. Rule of Construction.

  The objective of this License is to promote the freedom of all users
to run, copy, study, share and modify Covered Works.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, We grant You:

  (a) a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
make, copy, Distribute, publicly perform and publicly display Covered
Works, in any medium; and

  (b) a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
Licensed Patents to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import
and otherwise transfer Covered Works.

  The grants above are irrevocable and perpetual except to the extent
Your rights under this License are terminated under section 8.

  You may charge any fee for Distributing Covered Works and providing
services relating to Covered Works.

  This License is not intended to exclude or limit (i) any rights You
have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing or
other equivalents, and (ii) any implied license or other defense to
infringement that may otherwise be available to You under applicable
patent law.

  3. No Trademark License.

  This License does not grant any rights in Our name, trademarks,
service marks, or logos.

  4. Anti-Circumvention Law.

  When You Distribute a Covered Work, You waive any legal power to
forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with
respect to the Covered Work, and You disclaim any intention to limit
operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against
the work's users, Your or third parties' legal rights to forbid
circumvention of technological measures.

  5. Inbound = Outbound.

  Any Inbound Contribution shall be under this License, without any
additional terms or conditions, unless you explicitly indicate
otherwise before, or at the time, You submit the Inbound Contribution.

  6. Distribution: General.

  You may Distribute a Covered Work, provided that You meet all of
these conditions:

  a) Keep intact all copyright notices, textual author attributions,
     license notices, and warranty disclaimers contained in the
     Received Work (in the case of a Derived Work, to the extent such
     notices remain pertinent), and include a copy of this License
     along with the Covered Work or a pointer to a canonical Internet
     address at which a copy of this License is publicly available.

  b) For a Derived Work: License the entire Derived Work under this
     License, and include prominent notice of such licensing. This
     requirement may not be circumvented or diminished through such
     means as separate packaging or separate Distribution.  However,
     if We commercially offer a Covered Work under Proprietary
     Terms, this clause b) shall not apply to Your Derived Work.

  7. Object Code Distribution.

  You may Distribute a Covered Work in Object Code form, provided that
You also Distribute the machine-readable Corresponding Source under
this License, in one of the following ways:

    a) Simultaneous Availability of Corresponding Source:

      i) Distribute the Object Code in a physical product or tangible
         storage medium, accompanied by either a durable physical
         medium customarily used for software interchange that
         contains the Corresponding Source, or notice of a network
         location from which the Corresponding Source can be retrieved
         at no further charge. Or, 

     ii) Distribute the Object Code from a network location
         accompanied by information giving clear directions indicating
         how the Corresponding Source may be obtained from a network
         location at no further charge and in a reasonably equivalent
         manner.

    b) Offer for Source: Distribute the Object Code accompanied by a
       written offer, valid for at least three years and (where the
       Object Code is Distributed in a physical product) valid for as
       long as You offer spare parts or customer support for that
       product model, to give any third party a copy of the
       Corresponding Source either (1) on a durable physical medium
       customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more
       than Your reasonable cost of performing this Distribution of
       Corresponding Source, or (2) from a network server at no
       charge.

  8. Termination.

  If You fail to comply with this License, then, unless you cure such
failure within thirty days after becoming aware of such noncompliance,
Your rights under this License are automatically terminated. However,
the right to make copies necessarily incident to running Covered Works
shall never be terminated.

  Termination of Your rights under this section does not terminate the
rights of those who have received copies or rights from You subject to
this License.

  Termination of Your rights disqualifies You from receiving new
licenses for the same material under section 9.

  9. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time You Distribute a Covered Work, the recipient automatically
receives from Us a license to the Received Work subject to this
License.

 10. No Further Restrictions; Inbound License Compatibility.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License. 

  Further restrictions include, without limitation, initiation of
litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,
offering for sale, or importing the Received Work or any portion of
it.

  For the avoidance of doubt, Distribution of a Covered Work
incorporating material covered by the following free software licenses
is not imposition of a "further restriction". This list of licenses is
illustrative rather than exhaustive and is meant to guide general
interpretation of the initial clause of this section: 
    i) Apache License 2.0 as published by the Apache
Software Foundation 
   ii) MIT License, version at http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
  iii) 3-clause BSD License, version at http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause

  If a license document contains a further restriction but permits
relicensing or Distributing under this License, You may add to a
Covered Work material governed by the terms of that license document,
provided that the further restriction does not survive such
relicensing or Distributing.

  11. Liberty or Death.

  If conditions are imposed on You (whether by court order, agreement
or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
not excuse You from the conditions of this License.  If You cannot
Distribute a Covered Work in a way that would satisfy simultaneously
Your requirements under this License and any pertinent obligations
extrinsic to this License, then as a consequence You may not
Distribute it at all.  

  12. Outbound Compatibility with GNU Strong Copyleft Licenses.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, You have
permission to relicense any Covered Work under the terms of any
version of a GNU Strong Copyleft License. No condition of this License
that would conflict with the chosen GNU Strong Copyleft License shall
survive such relicensing.

  13. New Versions of this License.

  The initial License Steward is the Copyleft Next Group. The License
Steward may publish new versions of copyleft-next.  Each version will
be given a distinguishing version number. You may Distribute a Covered
Work under the terms of the version of copyleft-next under which the
Received Work is licensed, or under the terms of a newer version
published by the License Steward.

  14. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  The Received Work is provided “as-is.”  You bear the risk of using
it.  Neither We nor any Distributor gives any express warranties.  You
may have additional rights under applicable law which this License
cannot change.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, We and all
Distributors exclude the implied warranties of title, merchantability,
fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.

  15. Limitation of Liability.

  You cannot recover any damages from Us or any Distributor, including
direct, consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental
damages. This limitation applies to the exercise of any rights granted
or affirmed under this License, and to claims for breach of contract,
breach of warranty, strict liability, negligence or other tort to the
extent permitted by applicable law. It applies even if We or any
Distributor knew or should have known about the possibility of such
damages. The foregoing limitation may not apply to You under
applicable law.

  16. Severability.

  If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of this License, and reviewing courts shall reform such
provision to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid
and enforceable.
