                         Web Services Supplement

  This supplementary license document incorporates by reference the
terms and conditions of copyleft-next. If and only if We included
these supplementary terms along with the Program, they shall apply to
Covered Works.  Inclusion of these terms in a Distributed Covered Work
is otherwise a "further restriction" in violation of copyleft-next.

  Notwithstanding any provision of copyleft-next, if You create a
Derivative Work which supports remote interaction with users through a
computer network, Your Derivative Work must prominently offer all such
users an opportunity to receive its Corresponding Source by providing
access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge,
through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of
software.
