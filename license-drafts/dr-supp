                             copyleft-next
                       Delayed Release Supplement

  This supplementary license document incorporates by reference the terms
and conditions of copyleft-next. If and only if the Licensor included
these supplementary terms along with the Recieved Work, they shall apply
to Received Works. Inclusion of these terms in a Distributed Received
Work is otherwise a "further restriction" in violation of copyleft-next.

  "Initial Release" of Object Code means the date a specific version of a
Dervied Work is made available for Distribution. For the avoidance of
doubt, pre-release and testing versions of a Dervied Work are considered
separate versions, each with their own Initial Releases.

  If You create a Dervied Work and Distribute the resulting Object Code,
You may choose to, at Your discretion, choose to delay the release of the
Corresponding Source as required by Section 6 of copyleft-next by a
period of no more than twelve (12) months from the Initial Release of the
Dervied Work. At the end of this delay period, all Corresponding Source
must be Distributed pursuant to Section 6 of copyleft-next.
