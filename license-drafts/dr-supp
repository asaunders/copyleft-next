                             copyleft-next
                       Delayed Release Supplement

  This supplementary license document incorporates by reference the
terms and conditions of copyleft-next. If and only if We included
these supplementary terms along with the Program, they shall apply to
Covered Works.  Inclusion of these terms in a Distributed Covered Work
is otherwise a "further restriction" in violation of copyleft-next.

  "Initial Release" of Object Code means the date a specific version
of a Derivative Work is made available for Distribution. For the
avoidance of doubt, pre-release and testing versions of a Derivative
Work are considered separate versions, each with their own Initial
Releases.

  If You create a Derivative Work and Distribute the resulting Object
Code, You may choose to, at Your discretion, choose to delay the
release of the Corresponding Source as required by Section 6 of
copyleft-next by a period of no more than twelve (12) months from the
Initial Release of the Derivative Work. At the end of this delay period,
all Corresponding Source must be Distributed pursuant to Section 6 of
copyleft-next.
