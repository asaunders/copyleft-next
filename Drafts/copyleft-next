THIS IS A DRAFT. DO NOT USE AS A LICENSE.

                     copyleft-next ("this License")

0. Basic Definitions.

  "Covered Work" means the Received Work or a Derived Work.

  "Derived Work" means a work of authorship that copies from,
  modifies, adapts, is based on, contains, transforms or translates
  all or part of the Received Work such that copyright permission is
  required. Derived Works do not include Mere Aggregation or the mere
  making of a verbatim copy of the Received Work.

  "Distribute" means to transfer or make available a copy to someone
  else (in the case of an organization, to someone outside of the
  organization), such that copyright permission is required.

  "Distributor" means Us and anyone else who Distributes a Covered
   Work.

  "Mere Aggregation" means an aggregation of a Covered Work with a
  Separate Work. However, if the license of such an aggregation
  restricts users from exercising rights in the Covered Work given by
  this License, the aggregation is not Mere Aggregation.

  "Received Work" means the particular work of authorship We license
  to you under this License.

  "Separate Work" means a work that is separate from and independent
  of a particular Covered Work and is not by its nature an extension
  or enhancement of the Covered Work.

  "We"/"Us"/"Our" refers to the individual or organization that places
  the Received Work under this License.

1. License Grants.

   Subject to the conditions of this License, We grant you the
   following licenses:

   a. A non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright
      license, for the duration of Our copyright in the Received Work,
      to make, copy, Distribute, publicly perform and publicly display
      Covered Works, in any medium.

   b. A non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable patent
      license under Licensed Patents to make, have made, use, sell,
      offer for sale, import and otherwise transfer Covered
      Works. "Licensed Patents" means all patent claims licensable by
      Us, now or in the future, that are necessarily infringed by
      making, using, or selling the Received Work, but do not include
      claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further
      modification of the Received Work.

   This License is not intended to exclude or limit any rights you
   have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing
   or other equivalents, and any implied license or other defense to
   infringement that may otherwise be available to you under
   applicable patent law.

2. No Trademark License.

   This License does not grant any rights in Our name, trademarks,
   service marks, or logos.

3. Proprietary-Relicensing. 

   If and when We Proprietary-Relicense, now or in the future, you are
   not bound by sections 4 through 10 of this License.
   "Proprietary-Relicense" means to offer, for commercial gain, a work
   that would be a Covered Work had you prepared it, under a license
   that fails to satisfy version 1.111 of the Free Software Definition
   as published by the Free Software Foundation ("FSF").

4. Distribution: General Conditions.

   You may Distribute Covered Works, provided that you: 
   * preserve all legal notices and textual author attributions
     contained in the Received Work (in the case of a Derived Work, to
     the extent such notices remain pertinent);   
   * include a copy of this License along with the Covered Work; and
   * satisfy the applicable conditions of sections 5 through 8.

5. Distributing Derived Works.

   You may Distribute a Derived Work, provided that you license the
   entire Derived Work under this License, and include prominent
   notice of such licensing. This condition may not be avoided through
   such means as separate Distribution.

6. Direct Licensing.

   When you Distribute a Covered Work, the recipient automatically
   receives from Us a license to the Received Work subject to the
   terms of this License.

7. No Further Restrictions.

   You may not impose further restrictions on the exercise of the
   rights granted under this License ("Further Restrictions").

   The preceding condition is not excused merely because Further
   Restrictions result from your compliance with conditions or
   obligations extrinsic to this License (for example, a court order
   or an agreement with a third party).

   Distribution of a Covered Work incorporating material licensed
   under the Apache License 2.0 does not impose Further Restrictions.

8. Object Code Distribution.

8.1. General Definitions.

     "Minimum Period", with respect to a Covered Work embodied in a
     Product, means the longer of (i) two years from the date of your
     Distribution of the Covered Work in the Product, or (ii) the
     period during which you offer spare parts or customer support for
     the Product.

     "Object Code" means any form of a work that is not Source Code.

     "Product" means a physical product or tangible storage medium.

     "Source Code" means the preferred form of a work for making
     modifications to it.

     "System Libraries" means [FIXME].

8.2. Definition of Corresponding Source.
  
     "Corresponding Source" of a Covered Work means all the Source
     Code needed to build, compile, generate, modify, install, and run
     the Covered Work, to the extent those activities are meaningful
     ("Development Activities"). Corresponding Source must be in
     machine-readable form.

     Corresponding Source includes (i) all relevant scripts and
     instructions known to you (even if previously unrecorded)
     necessary for a skilled person to effectively perform, control
     and/or complete Development Activities; (ii) interface definition
     files; and (iii) the Source Code of shared libraries and
     dynamically-linked subprograms that the Covered Work is
     specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
     communication or control flow between those subprograms and parts
     of the Covered Work.

     Corresponding Source does not include (i) a Separate Work used in
     performing Development Activities, or (ii) the Covered Work's
     System Libraries.

8.3. Conditions for Distributing Object Code.

     You may Distribute a Covered Work in Object Code form, provided
     that:

     a. For Object Code Distributed in a Product: you accompany the
        Product with either:

        1) a durable physical medium customarily used for software
           interchange that contains the Corresponding Source, or

        2) notice of a network location through which the
           Corresponding Source is available under this License at no
           charge, for the Minimum Period.

     b. For Object Code Distributed from a network location: you
        accompany the Object Code with clear directions indicating how
        the Corresponding Source may be obtained under this License
        from a network location at no further charge and in a
        reasonably equivalent manner.

9. Outbound (A)GPL Compatibility.

   You may relicense Covered Works under the terms of one or more of
   the following licenses published by the Free Software Foundation:
   * GNU General Public License, version 2
   * GNU General Public License, version 3
   * GNU Affero General Public License, version 3
   * later versions of the foregoing licenses.

10. Termination.

10.1. If you fail to comply with the conditions of this License, then,
      unless you cure such violations of this License within thirty
      days after becoming aware of them, your license grants under
      section 1 are automatically terminated.

10.2. If you initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
      claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims,
      and cross-claims) alleging that any part of the Received Work
      directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then your license
      grants under section 1 are automatically terminated.

10.3. Termination of your rights disqualifies you from receiving new
      licenses covering the Received Work. It does not terminate the
      rights of those who have received copies or rights from you
      subject to this License.

10.4. Your right to make copies necessarily incident to running
      Covered Works shall never be terminated.

11. Later License Versions.

    The Copyleft-Next Project may publish new versions of
    copyleft-next, designated by a distinguishing version number, but
    no such new version is "Authorized" until it has been specifically
    approved as a new version by both the Free Software Foundation and
    the Open Source Initiative. You may Distribute a Covered Work
    under the terms of this License or under the terms of an
    Authorized newer version of copyleft-next.

12. No Warranty.

    The Received Work is provided "as-is", without warranty.  You bear
    the risk of using it.  You may have additional rights under
    applicable law which this License cannot change.  To the extent
    permitted by applicable law, each Distributor excludes the implied
    warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular
    purpose and non-infringement.

13. Limitation of Liability.

    To the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will any
    Distributor be liable to you for any damages whatsoever, whether
    direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages,
    whether arising under contract, tort (including negligence), or
    otherwise, even where the Distributor knew or should have known
    about the possibility of such damages.

14. Severability.

    If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
    of the remainder of this License, and reviewing courts shall
    reform such provision to the minimum extent necessary to make such
    provision valid and enforceable.
