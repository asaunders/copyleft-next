THIS IS A DRAFT. DO NOT USE AS A LICENSE.

		      copyleft-next ("this License")

1. Basic Definitions.

  "Covered Work" means the Received Work or a Derived Work.

  "Derived Work" means a work of authorship that copies from, modifies,
  adapts, is based on, contains, transforms or translates all or part of
  the Received Work such that copyright permission is required. Derived
  Works do not include Mere Aggregation or the mere making of a verbatim
  copy of the Received Work.

  "Distribute" means to transfer or make available a copy to someone else
  (in the case of an organization, to someone outside of the
  organization), such that copyright permission is required.

  "Distributor" means Us and anyone else who Distributes a Covered Work.

  "Mere Aggregation" means an aggregation of a Covered Work with a Separate
  Work. However, if the license of such an aggregation restricts users from 
  exercising rights in the Covered Work given by this License, the 
  aggregation is not Mere Aggregation.

  "Object Code" means any form of a work that is not Source Code.

  "Received Work" means the particular work of authorship We license to you
  under this License.

  "Separate Work" means a work that is separate from and independent of a
  particular Covered Work and is not by its nature an extension or
  enhancement of the Covered Work, and/or a runtime library, standard
  library or similar component bundled with a Separate Work that is used to
  generate an Object Code form of the Covered Work.

  "Source Code" means the preferred form of a work for making modifications
  to it.

  "We"/"Us"/"Our" refers to the individual or organization that places the
  Received Work under this License.

2. License Grants.

   Subject to the terms of this License, We grant you:

   a) A non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright
      license, for the duration of Our copyright in the Received Work, to
      make, copy, Distribute, publicly perform and publicly display Covered
      Works, in any medium.

   b) A non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license
      under Licensed Patents to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale,
      import and otherwise transfer Covered Works. "Licensed Patents" means
      all patent claims licensable by Us, now or in the future, that are 
      necessarily infringed by making, using, or selling the Received Work,
      but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a 
      consequence of further modification of the Received Work.

   This License is not intended to exclude or limit any rights you have
   under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing or other
   equivalents, and any implied license or other defense to infringement
   that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

3. No Trademark License.

   This License does not grant any rights in Our name, trademarks, service
   marks, or logos.

4. Proprietary-Relicensing. 

   If and when We Proprietary-Relicense, now or in the future, you are not
   bound by sections 5 through 11 of this License. "Proprietary-Relicense"
   means to offer a work that would be a Covered Work had you prepared it,
   under a license that fails to satisfy the Free Software Definition,
   version 1.111, as published by the Free Software Foundation ("FSF").

5. Distribution: General Conditions.

   You may Distribute Covered Works, provided that you: 

   a) preserve all legal notices and textual author attributions contained
      in the Received Work (in the case of a Derived Work, to the extent
      such notices remain pertinent);

   b) inform recipients how they can obtain a copy of this License; and

   c) satisfy the applicable conditions of sections 6 through 9.

6. Distributing Derived Works.

   If you Distribute a Derived Work, you must license the entire Derived
   Work as a whole under this License, with prominent notice of such
   licensing. This condition may not be avoided through such means as
   separate Distribution of portions of the Derived Work.

7. Direct Licensing.

   When you Distribute a Covered Work, the recipient automatically receives
   from Us a license to the Received Work subject to the terms of this 
   License.

8. No Further Restrictions.

   You may not impose further restrictions on the exercise of the rights 
   granted under this License. This condition is not excused merely because 
   such restrictions result from your compliance with conditions or 
   obligations extrinsic to this License (for example, a court order or an 
   agreement with a third party). 

   Mere Distribution of a Covered Work incorporating material licensed
   under the Apache License 2.0 does not impose "further restrictions"
   under this section.

9. Object Code Distribution.

   "Corresponding Source" of a Covered Work means (i) the Source Code of
   the Covered Work; (ii) all scripts, instructions and information known
   to you necessary for a skilled developer to build, compile, generate 
   and modify the Covered Work; (iii) all relevant interface definition 
   files; (iv) the Source Code of shared libraries that the Covered Work is 
   specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication 
   or control flow between those libraries and parts of the Covered Work; 
   and (v) a list clearly identifying all Separate Works that were used in 
   building, compiling, generating and installing the Covered Work. 
   Corresponding Source must be in machine-readable form.

   You may Distribute a Covered Work in Object Code form, provided that:

   a) For Object Code Distributed in a physical product or tangible storage
      medium ("Product"): you accompany the Product with either: (i) a
      durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange
      that contains the Corresponding Source, or (ii) notice of a network 
      location through which the Corresponding Source is available, for the
      Minimum Period, under this License and at no charge. "Minimum Period"
      means the longer of (i) two years from the date of your Distribution 
      of the Covered Work in the Product, or (ii) the period during which 
      you offer spare parts or customer support for the Product.

   b) For Object Code Distributed from a network location: you accompany
      the Object Code with clear directions indicating how the
      Corresponding Source may be obtained under this License from a
      network location at no further charge and in a reasonably equivalent
      manner.

10. Outbound (A)GPL Compatibility.

    You may Distribute a Covered Work under one or more of the following
    licenses published by the FSF:
    * GNU General Public License, version 2
    * GNU Affero General Public License, version 3
    * later versions of the foregoing licenses.

11. Termination.

11.1 If you fail to comply with the conditions of this License, then,
     unless you cure such noncompliance within thirty days after becoming
     aware of it, your license grants under section 2 are automatically
     terminated.

11.2 If you initiate a patent infringement litigation claim (excluding
     declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims, and cross-claims)
     alleging that any part of the Received Work directly or indirectly
     infringes any patent, then your license grants under section 2 are
     automatically terminated.

11.3 Termination of your rights disqualifies you from receiving new
     licenses covering the Received Work, but it does not terminate the
     rights of those who have received copies or rights from you subject to
     this License.

11.4 To the extent permission to make copies of a Covered Work is necessary 
     for running it, such permission is not terminable.

12. Later License Versions.

    The Copyleft-Next Project may publish new versions of copyleft-next,
    designated by a distinguishing version number. Unless We explicitly 
    remove the option of Distributing Covered Works under later published 
    versions of copyleft-next, you may Distribute Covered Works under any 
    later version of copyleft-next.

15. Severability.

    The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this License 
    does not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of 
    this License. Such provision is to be reformed to the minimum extent 
    necessary to make it valid and enforceable.
