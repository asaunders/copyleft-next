THIS IS A DRAFT. DO NOT USE AS A LICENSE.

                      copyleft-next ("this License")

1. License Grants

   Subject to the terms of this License, I grant You:

   a) A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license, to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works
      of, publicly perform and publicly display My Work.

   b) A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable
      patent license under Licensed Patents to make, have made, use, sell,
      offer for sale, and import Covered Works.

   This License does not exclude or limit any rights You have under
   applicable law.

   This License does not grant any rights in My name, trademarks, service
   marks, or logos.

2. Copyleft Nullification

   I additionally license My Work to You under the Apache License if:

   a) more than one year after My first Distribution of My Work under this
      License, I offer to license a work that would be a Covered Work had
      You prepared it, under terms that fail to satisfy the Open Source
      Definition published by the Open Source Initiative as of 1 January
      2013; or

   b) My Work is in Object Code form and I do not Give Corresponding
      Source.

   This provision does not affect the license of any preexisting material
   contained in My Work over which I do not hold copyright.

3. Distribution: General Conditions

   You may Distribute Covered Works, provided that You (i) inform
   recipients how they can obtain a copy of this License; (ii) satisfy the
   applicable conditions of sections 4 through 6; and (iii) preserve all
   Legal Notices contained in My Work (to the extent they remain
   pertinent). "Legal Notices" means copyright notices, license notices,
   license texts, and author attributions, but does not include logos,
   other graphical images or trademark legends.

4. Conditions for Distributing Derived Works; Outbound GPL Compatibility

   If You Distribute a Derived Work, You must license the entire Derived
   Work as a whole under this License, with prominent notice of such
   licensing. This condition may not be avoided through such means as
   separate Distribution of portions of the Derived Work.

   You may additionally license the Derived Work under any version of the
   GNU General Public License published by the Free Software Foundation
   ("GPL"), so that the recipient may further Distribute the Derived Work
   under either this License or the GPL.

5. Condition Against Further Restrictions

   When Distributing a Covered Work, You may not impose further
   restrictions on the exercise of rights in the Covered Work granted under
   this License. This condition is not excused merely because such
   restrictions result from Your compliance with conditions or obligations
   extrinsic to this License (such as a court order or an agreement with a
   third party). Mere Distribution of a Covered Work incorporating material
   licensed under the Apache License does not impose further restrictions
   under this section.

6. Conditions for Distributing Object Code

   You may Distribute an Object Code form of a Covered Work, provided that
   You also Give Corresponding Source.

   Each recipient of the Covered Work from You is an intended third-party
   beneficiary of this License solely as to this section 7, with the right
   to enforce its terms.

7. Pass-Through

   When You Distribute a Covered Work, the recipient automatically receives
   from Me a license to My Work subject to the terms of this License.

8. Termination

    Your license grants under section 1 are automatically terminated if You

    a) fail to comply with the conditions of this License, unless You cure
       such noncompliance within thirty days after becoming aware of it, or

    b) initiate a patent infringement litigation claim (excluding
       declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims, and cross-claims)
       alleging that any part of My Work directly or indirectly infringes
       any patent.

    Termination of Your rights disqualifies You from receiving new licenses
    covering My Work, but it does not terminate the rights of those who
    have received copies or rights from You subject to this License.

    To the extent permission to make copies of a Covered Work is necessary
    merely for running it, such permission is not terminable.

9. Later License Versions

   The Copyleft-Next Project may release new versions of copyleft-next,
   designated by a distinguishing version number ("Later Versions").
   Unless I explicitly remove the option of Distributing Covered Works
   under Later Versions, You may Distribute Covered Works under any Later
   Version.

##     My Work is provided "as-is", without warranty. You bear the risk  ##
##     of using it. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each      ##
##     Distributor excludes the implied warranties of title,             ##
##     merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and             ##

##     To the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will any   ##
##     Distributor be liable to You for any damages whatsoever, whether  ##
##     direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages,  ##
##     whether arising under contract, tort (including negligence), or   ##
##     otherwise, even where the Distributor knew or should have known   ##
##     about the possibility of such damages.                            ##

12. Severability

    The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this License
    does not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
    this License. Such provision is to be reformed to the minimum extent
    necessary to make it valid and enforceable.

13. Definitions

    "Apache License" means the Apache License, version 2.0, as published by
    the Apache Software Foundation.

    "Copyleft-Next Project" means the project that maintains the source
    code repository at <https://gitorious.org/copyleft-next/> as of the
    release date of this License.

    "Corresponding Source" of a Covered Work in Object Code form means (i)
    the Source Code form of the Covered Work; (ii) all scripts,
    instructions and similar information that are reasonably necessary for
    a skilled developer to generate the Covered Work from the Source Code
    provided under (i); and (iii) a list clearly identifying all Separate
    Works (other than those provided in compliance with (ii)) that were
    specifically used in building and installing the Covered Work (for
    example, a specified proprietary compiler including its version
    number). Corresponding Source must be machine-readable.

    "Covered Work" means My Work or a Derived Work.

    "Derived Work" means a work of authorship that copies from, modifies,
    adapts, is based on, contains, transforms or translates all or part of
    My Work. Derived Works do not include Mere Aggregation or the mere
    making of a verbatim copy of My Work.

    "Distribute" means to distribute, transfer or make a copy available to
    someone else.

    "Distributor" means Me and anyone else who Distributes a Covered Work.

    A Distributor "Gives" Corresponding Source if:

    a) for a Covered Work Distributed in a physical product or tangible
       storage medium ("Product"), the Distributor accompanies the Product
       with either: (i) a durable physical medium customarily used for
       software interchange that contains the Covered Work's Corresponding
       Source or (ii) notice of a network location through which such
       Corresponding Source is available, at no charge, for two years from
       the date of the Distributor's most recent Distribution of the
       Covered Work in an identical Product;

    b) for a Covered Work Distributed through a computer network, the
       Distributor accompanies the Covered Work with clear directions
       indicating how the Covered Work's Corresponding Source may be
       obtained from a network location at no charge and in a reasonably
       equivalent manner.

    "Licensed Patents" means all patent claims licensable by Me, now or in
    the future, that are necessarily infringed by making, using, or selling
    My Work, and excludes claims that would be infringed only as a
    consequence of further modification of My Work.

    "Mere Aggregation" means an aggregation of a Covered Work with a
    Separate Work.

    "Object Code" means any form of a work that is not Source Code.

    "My Work" means the particular work of authorship I license to You
    under this License.

    "Separate Work" means a work that is separate from and independent of a
    particular Covered Work and is not by its nature an extension or
    enhancement of the Covered Work, and/or a runtime library, standard
    library or similar component that is used to generate an Object Code
    form of a Covered Work.

    "Source Code" means the preferred form of a work for making
    modifications to it.

    "I"/"Me"/"My" refers to the individual or legal entity that places My
    Work under this License. "You"/"Your" refers to the individual or legal
    entity exercising rights in My Work under this License. A legal entity
    includes each entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under
    common control with such legal entity. "Control" means (a) the power to
    direct the actions of such legal entity, whether by contract or
    otherwise, or (b) ownership of more than fifty percent of the
    outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such legal entity.
