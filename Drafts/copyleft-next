THIS IS A DRAFT. DO NOT USE AS A LICENSE.

                      copyleft-next ("this License")

1. License Grants

   Subject to the terms of this License, I grant You:

   a) A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license, to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works
      of, publicly perform, and publicly display My Work.

   b) A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable
      patent license under Licensed Patents to make, have made, use, sell,
      offer for sale, and import Covered Works.

2. Distributing Covered Works

   You may distribute Covered Works, subject to the following terms:

   a) Notice Requirements

      The Covered Work must inform recipients how they can obtain a copy of
      this License and preserve all pertinent Legal Notices contained in My
      Work. "Legal Notices" means copyright notices, license notices,
      license texts, and author attributions, but does not include logos,
      other graphical images, trademarks, or trademark legends.

   b) No Further Restrictions

      You may not impose further restrictions on the exercise of rights in
      the Covered Work granted under this License. This condition is not
      excused merely because such restrictions result from Your compliance
      with conditions or obligations extrinsic to this License (such as a
      court order or an agreement with a third party).

      Distribution of a Covered Work incorporating material governed by a
      license listed in Appendix A does not impose further restrictions.
      You have permission to ignore subsection 2c solely to the extent
      necessary to comply with such other license. However, the requirement
      in subsection 2d to provide Corresponding Source is in no case
      limited by this permission.The Appendix A list is intended to be
      illustrative and not exhaustive.

      Reasonable and narrowly-tailored measures taken by You to comply with
      applicable export control laws do not impose further restrictions.

   c) Derived Works; Outbound GPL Compatibility

      If You distribute a Derived Work, You must license the Derived Work
      as a whole under this License, with prominent notice of such
      licensing. This condition may not be avoided through such means as
      separate distribution of portions of the Derived Work. You may
      additionally license the Derived Work under the GPL, so that the
      recipient may further distribute the Derived Work under either this
      License or the GPL.

   d) Object Code

      If the Covered Work is in Object Code form, You must accompany the
      Object Code with a URL through which the Corresponding Source is made
      available, at no charge, by some standard or customary means of
      providing network access to source code.

      If you distribute the Object Code in a physical product or tangible
      storage medium ("Product"), the Corresponding Source must be
      available through such URL for two years from the date of Your most
      recent distribution of the Object Code in the Product. However, if
      the Product itself contains or is accompanied by the Corresponding
      Source (readily accessible to the Product user), You need not also
      comply with the preceding paragraph.

      Each recipient of the Covered Work from You is an intended
      third-party beneficiary of this License solely as to this subsection
      2d, with the right to enforce its terms.

   e) Pass-Through

      When You distribute a Covered Work, the recipient automatically
      receives a license to My Work from Me, subject to the terms of this
      License.

   Subsections 2a through 2d are conditions of this License.

3. Affero Clause

   FIXME

4. Nullification of Copyleft/Proprietary Dual Licensing

   If I distribute a Covered Work under a Proprietary License, then the
   licenses I grant You under section 1 are no longer subject to the
   conditions in sections 2 and 3.

5. Copyleft Sunset

   The conditions in sections 2 through 4 no longer apply once fifteen
   years have elapsed from the date of My first distribution of My Work
   under this License.

6. Symmetrical Licensing Condition for Upstream Contributions

   If You distribute any material to a Project specifically for inclusion
   in or modification or extension of a Covered Work (a "Patch"), and You
   do not apply any explicit licensing terms to such material, You hereby
   license the Patch under this License.

7. No Trademark License

   This License does not grant any rights in My name, trademarks, service
   marks, or logos.

8. Termination

    Your license grants under section 1 are automatically terminated if You

    a) fail to comply with the conditions of this License, unless You cure
       such noncompliance within thirty days after becoming aware of it, or

    b) initiate a patent infringement litigation claim (excluding
       counterclaims and cross-claims) alleging that all or part of My Work
       directly or indirectly infringes a patent.

    Termination of Your license grants extends to all copies of Covered
    Works You subsequently obtain.

    Termination of Your license grants does not terminate the licenses of
    those who have received copies of Covered Works from You.

    Licenses needed solely to run a copy of a Covered Work shall never be
    terminated.

9. Later License Versions

   The Copyleft-Next Project may release new versions of copyleft-next,
   designated by a distinguishing version number ("Later Versions").
   Unless I explicitly remove the option of distributing Covered Works
   under Later Versions, You may distribute Covered Works under any Later
   Version.

10. No Warranty

    Covered Works are provided "as-is", without warranty. You bear the risk
    of using them. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each
    distributor of a Covered Work excludes the implied warranties of title,
    merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

11. Limitation of Liability

    To the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will any
    distributor of a Covered Work be liable to You for any damages
    whatsoever, whether direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
    consequential damages, whether arising under contract, tort
    (including negligence), or otherwise, even where the distributor knew
    or should have known about the possibility of such damages.

12. Severability

    The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this License
    does not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
    this License. Such provision is to be reformed to the minimum extent
    necessary to make it valid and enforceable.

13. Definitions

    "Copyleft-Next Project" means the project that maintains the source
    code repository at <https://gitorious.org/copyleft-next/> as of the
    release date of this License.

    "Corresponding Source" of a Covered Work in Object Code form means (i)
    the Source Code form of the Covered Work; (ii) all scripts,
    instructions, know-how, and similar information that are reasonably
    necessary for a skilled developer to generate such Object Code from the
    Source Code provided under (i); and (iii) a list clearly identifying
    all Separate Works (other than those provided in compliance with (ii))
    that were specifically used in building and (if applicable) installing
    the Covered Work (for example, a specified proprietary compiler including
    its version number). Corresponding Source must be machine-readable.

    "Covered Work" means My Work or a Derived Work.

    "Derived Work" means a work of authorship that copies from, modifies,
    adapts, is based on, is a derivative work of, transforms, translates,
    or contains all or part of My Work, such that copyright permission is
    required. The following are not Derived Works: (i) Mere Aggregation;
    (ii) a mere reproduction of My Work; and (iii) if My Work fails to
    explicitly state an expectation otherwise, a work that merely makes
    reference to My Work.

    "GPL" means a version of the GNU General Public License published
    by the Free Software Foundation.

    "I"/"Me"/"My" refers to the individual or legal entity that places My
    Work under this License. "You"/"Your" refers to the individual or legal
    entity exercising rights in My Work under this License. A legal entity
    includes each entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under
    common control with such legal entity. "Control" means (a) the power to
    direct the actions of such legal entity, whether by contract or
    otherwise, or (b) ownership of more than fifty percent of the
    outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such legal entity.

    "Licensed Patents" means all patent claims licensable royalty-free by
    Me, now or in the future, that are necessarily infringed by making,
    using, or selling My Work, and excludes claims that would be infringed
    only as a consequence of further modification of My Work.

    "Mere Aggregation" means an aggregation of a Covered Work with a
    Separate Work.

    "My Work" means the particular work of authorship I license to You
    under this License.

    "Object Code" means any form of a work that is not Source Code.

    "Proprietary License" means FIXME.

    "Separate Work" means a work that is separate from and independent of a
    particular Covered Work and is not by its nature an extension or
    enhancement of the Covered Work, and/or a runtime library, standard
    library, or similar component that is used to generate an Object Code
    form of a Covered Work.

    "Source Code" means the preferred form of a work for making
    modifications to it.
