THIS IS A DRAFT. DO NOT USE AS A LICENSE.

                     copyleft-next ("this License")

0. Basic Definitions.

  "Covered Work" means the Received Work or a Derived Work.

  "Derived Work" means a work of authorship that copies from,
  modifies, adapts, is based on, contains, transforms or translates
  all or part of the Received Work such that copyright permission is
  required. Derived Works do not include Mere Aggregation or the mere
  making of a verbatim copy of the Received Work.

  "Distribute" means to transfer or make available a copy to someone
  else (in the case of an organization, to someone outside of the
  organization), such that copyright permission is required.

  "Distributor" means Us and anyone else who Distributes a Covered
   Work.

  "Mere Aggregation" means an aggregation of a Covered Work with a
  Separate Work. However, if the license of such an aggregation
  restricts users from exercising rights in the Covered Work given by
  this License, the aggregation is not Mere Aggregation.

  "Object Code" means any form of a work that is not Source Code.

  "Received Work" means the particular work of authorship We license
  to you under this License.

  "Separate Work" means a work that is separate from and independent
  of a particular Covered Work and is not by its nature an extension
  or enhancement of the Covered Work, and/or a runtime library,
  standard library or similar component bundled with a Separate Work
  that is used to generate an Object Code form of the Covered Work.

  "Source Code" means the preferred form of a work for making
  modifications to it.

  "We"/"Us"/"Our" refers to the individual or organization that places
  the Received Work under this License.

1. License Grants.

   Subject to the terms of this License, We grant you:

   a. A non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright
      license, for the duration of Our copyright in the Received Work,
      to make, copy, Distribute, publicly perform and publicly display
      Covered Works, in any medium.

   b. A non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable patent
      license under Licensed Patents to make, have made, use, sell,
      offer for sale, import and otherwise transfer Covered
      Works. "Licensed Patents" means all patent claims licensable by
      Us, now or in the future, that are necessarily infringed by
      making, using, or selling the Received Work, but do not include
      claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further
      modification of the Received Work.

   This License is not intended to exclude or limit any rights you
   have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing
   or other equivalents, and any implied license or other defense to
   infringement that may otherwise be available to you under
   applicable patent law.

2. No Trademark License.

   This License does not grant any rights in Our name, trademarks,
   service marks, or logos.

3. Proprietary-Relicensing. 

   If and when We Proprietary-Relicense, now or in the future, you are
   not bound by sections 4 through 10 of this License.
   "Proprietary-Relicense" means to offer a work that would be a
   Covered Work had you prepared it, under a license that fails to
   satisfy the Free Software Definition, version 1.111, as published
   by the Free Software Foundation ("FSF").

4. Distribution: General Conditions.

   You may Distribute Covered Works, provided that you: 
   a) preserve all legal notices and textual author attributions
      contained in the Received Work (in the case of a Derived Work, to
      the extent such notices remain pertinent);   
   b) inform recipients how they can obtain a copy of this License; and
   c) satisfy the applicable conditions of sections 5 through 8.

5. Distributing Derived Works.

   If you Distribute a Derived Work, you must license the entire
   Derived Work as a whole under this License, with prominent notice
   of such licensing. This condition may not be avoided through such
   means as separate Distribution of portions of the Derived Work.

6. Direct Licensing.

   When you Distribute a Covered Work, the recipient automatically
   receives from Us a license to the Received Work subject to the
   terms of this License.

7. No Further Restrictions.

7.1 You may not impose further restrictions on the exercise of the
    rights granted under this License ("Further Restrictions").

7.2 The preceding condition is not excused merely because Further
    Restrictions result from your compliance with conditions or
    obligations extrinsic to this License (for example, a court order
    or an agreement with a third party).

7.3 Distribution of a Covered Work incorporating material licensed
    under the Apache License 2.0 does not impose Further Restrictions.

8. Object Code Distribution.

   "Corresponding Source" of a Covered Work means 
   (i) the Source Code of the Covered Work;
   (ii) all scripts, instructions or information known to you
   necessary for a skilled developer to build, compile, generate,
   modify, install and run the Covered Work ("Development
   Activities");
   (iii) all relevant interface definition files;
   (iv) the Source Code of shared libraries that the Covered Work is
   specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
   communication or control flow between those libraries and parts of
   the Covered Work; and
   (v) a list clearly identifying all Separate Works used in
   performing Development Activities. 
   Corresponding Source must be in machine-readable form.

   You may Distribute a Covered Work in Object Code form, provided
   that:

   a) For Object Code Distributed in a physical product or tangible
      storage medium ("Product"): you accompany the Product with
      either: (i) a durable physical medium customarily used for
      software interchange that contains the Corresponding Source, or
      (ii) notice of a network location through which the
      Corresponding Source is available, for the Minimum Period, under
      this License and at no charge.  "Minimum Period" means the
      longer of (i) two years from the date of your Distribution of
      the Covered Work in the Product, or (ii) the period during which
      you offer spare parts or customer support for the Product.

   b) For Object Code Distributed from a network location: you
      accompany the Object Code with clear directions indicating how
      the Corresponding Source may be obtained under this License from
      a network location at no further charge and in a reasonably
      equivalent manner.

9. Outbound (A)GPL Compatibility.

   You may Distribute Covered Works under the terms of one or more of
   the following licenses published by the FSF:
   * GNU General Public License, version 2
   * GNU Affero General Public License, version 3
   * later versions of the foregoing licenses.

10. Termination.

10.1 If you fail to comply with the conditions of this License, then,
     unless you cure such noncompliance within thirty days after
     becoming aware of it, your license grants under section 1 are
     automatically terminated.

10.2 If you initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
     claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims, and
     cross-claims) alleging that any part of the Received Work
     directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then your license
     grants under section 1 are automatically terminated.

10.3 Termination of your rights disqualifies you from receiving new
     licenses covering the Received Work, but it does not terminate
     the rights of those who have received copies or rights from you
     subject to this License.

10.4 Your right to make copies necessarily incident to running Covered
     Works shall never be terminated.

11. Later License Versions.

    The Copyleft-Next Project may publish new versions of
    copyleft-next, designated by a distinguishing version number.
    Unless the Received Work explicitly removes the option of
    Distributing Covered Works under later published versions of
    copyleft-next, you may Distribute Covered Works under any later
    version of copyleft-next.

14. Severability.

    If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
    of the remainder of this License, and reviewing courts shall
    reform such provision to the minimum extent necessary to make such
    provision valid and enforceable.
