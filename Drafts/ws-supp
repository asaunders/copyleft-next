                         Web Services Supplement

  This supplementary license document incorporates by reference the
terms and conditions of copyleft-next. If and only if We included
these supplementary terms along with the Received Work, they shall
apply to Covered Works.  Inclusion of these terms in a Distributed
Covered Work is otherwise a "further restriction" in violation of
copyleft-next. 

  Therefore, these terms can only apply to the Received Work if the
initial licensor of the Received Work applied them. 

  If you create a Derived Work which supports remote interaction with
users through a computer network, your Derived Work must prominently
offer all such users an opportunity to receive its Corresponding
Source by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network
server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of
facilitating copying of software.
