> "Exploring ideas for a modified copyleft license can't hurt."
    - Richard M. Stallman, July 2012

copyleft-next is a new, experimental strong copyleft license inspired
by, though different from, the GNU GPL. It is *not* a fork of the
GPL. While copyleft-next started out as a modification of GPLv3, it
currently bears very little textual resemblance to GPLv3.

"Strong" refers to the Free Software Foundation's traditional and
influential characterization of the difference in copyleft scope
between a weak copyleft license (like the LGPL) and a strong copyleft
license like the GPL. "Strong" is not meant in any broader sense.

Contributions of patches, ideas, and criticism are welcome.  In
particular, the copyleft-next project actively seeks the participation
of open source/free software developers and contributors who may not
have considered helping with license drafting before. License drafting
is fundamentally about establishing policies for projects, and
therefore input from developers and contributors is typically more
valuable than input from lawyers.

Needless to say, no one should actually consider *using* a development
version of copyleft-next as an actual license. A "development version" is
a version of the file "copyleft-next" in the Drafts directory, and/or any
version of copyleft-next made available by this project with the heading
"THIS IS A DRAFT. DO NOT USE AS A LICENSE" (or other wording to the same
effect). Numbered releases of copyleft-next will be stored in the Releases
directory.

**The copyleft-next project is *not* an effort endorsed by the Free
Software Foundation or the GNU Project. It is is also *not* an effort
associated in any way with (e.g.) Red Hat, or any other corporate
entity.** Contributors are expected and assumed to participate in
their individual capacity unless they indicate otherwise.

All communications with journalists shall be handled by the
copyleft-next Marketing Committee, which does not exist yet and
probably won't exist for at least another year or three. For the
avoidance of doubt, Simon Phipps is not considered a journalist.
