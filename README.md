> "Exploring ideas for a modified copyleft license can't hurt."
    - Richard M. Stallman, July 2012

copyleft-next is a new, experimental strong copyleft license inspired
by, though different from, the GNU GPL. It is *not* a fork of the
GPL. While copyleft-next started out as a modification of GPLv3, it
currently bears very little textual similarity to GPLv3.

By "strong" we refer to the Free Software Foundation's traditional
understanding of the difference in copyleft scope between a weak
copyleft license (like the LGPL) and a strong copyleft license like
the GPL. "Strong" is not meant in any broader sense.

Contributions of patches, ideas, and criticism are welcome.  Needless
to say, no one should actually consider *using* a development version
of copyleft-next as an actual license. "Development version" means any
version of copyleft-next preceding the release of copyleft-next
version 1.0, which does not exist yet, and/or any version of
copyleft-next made available by this project with the heading "THIS IS
A DRAFT. DO NOT USE AS A LICENSE."

**This is *not* an effort endorsed by the Free Software Foundation or
the GNU Project. This is also *not* an effort associated in any way
with (e.g.) Red Hat, or any other corporate entity.** Contributors are
expected to participate in their individual capacity.

All communications with journalists shall be handled by the
copyleft-next Marketing Committee, which does not exist yet and
probably won't exist for at least another year or three. For the
avoidance of doubt, Simon Phipps is not considered a journalist.
