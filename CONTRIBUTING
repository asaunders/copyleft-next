Contributions of any sort (text suggestions, ideas, feedback,
criticism) from all interested individuals are welcome and encouraged.
All original contributions to copyleft-next are dedicated to the
public domain to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,
pursuant to CC0. See CC0 for further details.

Contributions from individual free/libre/open source software project
participants, regardless of their views on copyleft, and regardless of
their opinions on existing licenses such as the GNU GPLv2 and its
successors, are especially welcome and strongly encouraged.

Given the nature of the subject matter, it is conceivable that lawyers
will wish to participate in this project. A nontrivial number of
interesting collaborative FLOSS legal endeavors have been operated in
a relatively nontransparent and methodologically suboptimal
manner. This project aims to be different, and this therefore
necessitates the following rules of participation:

  * Contributions in the form of word-processing documents (even if in
    a free/open standard format), "redlined" or otherwise, are
    unacceptable and will be deleted immediately.

  * No private mailing lists (governed by the so-called Chatham House
    Rule or similar) will be used by this project. If mailing lists
    are used, their archives will be public. 

  * All who wish to contribute are expected to do so by using the same
    software development methodology already in place for this project
    (for example, the use of git). 

  * Private telephone calls, private teleconferences and private
    in-person meetings shall not be used to discuss substantive
    development of this project.
