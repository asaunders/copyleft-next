Harvey Birdman Rule
===================

Contributions from lawyers are welcome, but note that the Harvey
Birdman Rule applies to such contributions (as well as to
contributions from non-lawyers, of course). Stated here for the first
time, and subject to revision and further elaboration, the Harvey
Birdman Rule means:

  * Contributions in the form of word-processing documents (even if in
    a free/open standard format), "redlined" or otherwise, are
    unacceptable and will be deleted immediately.

  * No private mailing lists (governed by the so-called Chatham House
    Rule or similar) will be used by this project. If mailing lists
    are used, their archives will be public. 

  * All who wish to contribute are expected to do so by using the same
    software development methodology already in place for this project
    (for example, the use of git). 


Public Source Locations
=======================

Gitorious (https://gitorious.org/copyleft-next) is now the centralized
location of source for this project. It will be mirrored at a GitHub
repo (currently https://github.com/richardfontana/Copyleft.next) for
the time being, and perhaps indefinitely.


Issue Tracking
==============

The issue tracker associated with
https://github.com/richardfontana/Copyleft.next shall be kept open for the
time being, but at some point it is likely to be disabled.
