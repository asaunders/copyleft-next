Contributions of any sort (text suggestions, ideas, feedback,
criticism) from all interested individuals are welcome and encouraged.
All original contributions to copyleft-next are dedicated to the
public domain to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,
pursuant to CC0. See CC0 for further details.

Contributions from individual free/libre/open source software project
participants, regardless of their views on copyleft, and regardless of
their opinions on existing licenses such as the GNU GPLv2 and its
successors, are especially welcome and strongly encouraged.

Given the nature of the subject matter, it is conceivable that lawyers
will wish to participate in this project. All actual and potential
participants are on notice that this project is governed by the Harvey
Birdman Rule (see below). While lawyers are as welcome to participate
as anyone else, lawyers should take particular care in noting the
requirements of the Harvey Birdman Rule, as past lawyer-dominated
participatory FLOSS legal endeavors were often operated in a manner
contrary to such norms.


Harvey Birdman Rule
===================

Subject to revision and further elaboration, the Harvey Birdman Rule
means:

  * Contributions in the form of word-processing documents (even if in
    a free/open standard format), "redlined" or otherwise, are
    unacceptable and will be deleted immediately.

  * No private mailing lists (governed by the so-called Chatham House
    Rule or similar) will be used by this project. If mailing lists
    are used, their archives will be public. 

  * All who wish to contribute are expected to do so by using the same
    software development methodology already in place for this project
    (for example, the use of git). 

  * Private telephone calls, private teleconferences and private
    in-person meetings shall not be used to discuss substantive
    development of this project.


Public Source Locations
=======================

Gitorious (https://gitorious.org/copyleft-next) is now the centralized
location of source for this project. 


Issue Tracking
==============

The issue tracker associated with
https://github.com/richardfontana/Copyleft.next shall be kept open for the
time being, but at some point it is likely to be disabled.
