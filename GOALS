likely that some of these goals are in conflict with one another.

* Make the license shorter (the jocularly-expressed objective here is
  "one line shorter than the Apache License 2.0")

* Make the license terms easier for nonlawyers to understand

* Investigate possible improvements to the basic legal implementation
  of strong copyleft policy

* Explicitly codify "inbound=outbound" project contribution policy

* Discourage so-called proprietary relicensing

* Address practical issues that have arisen in GNU GPL compliance
