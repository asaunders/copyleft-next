                         Web Services Supplement

  This supplementary license document ("WS-Supp") incorporates by
reference the terms and conditions of copyleft-next. If and only if We
included WS-Supp along with the Program, it shall apply to Covered
Works.  Inclusion of WS-Supp in a Distributed Covered Work is
otherwise a "further restriction" in violation of copyleft-next.

  Notwithstanding any provision of copyleft-next, if you create a
Derivative Work which supports remote interaction with users through a
computer network, Your Derivative Work must prominently offer all such
users an opportunity to receive its Corresponding Source by providing
access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge,
through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of
software.
